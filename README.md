## Warning

This project is still in a very early development stage. The code is not yet stable and may change significantly in the future. Please use it at your own risk and do not use it in a world you value.

While I will try not to make breaking changes, it is possible that a future update will break your world, even making it unplayable. Feel free to file an issue if that happens, but I cannot guarantee that I can fix it.

## Other model loaders / Minecraft versions support?

Fabric + Minecraft 1.21.1 only for now. If there's demand for neoforge or older minecraft versions, I might work on that.

No plans to support forge.
